# System-Software
<p align='left'>System software constitutes a critical layer of software that facilitates the operation of computer hardware and provides a platform for running application software. It comprises a suite of programs designed to manage, control, and support the operation of a computer system. At its core, system software includes the operating system (OS), which acts as the primary interface between hardware components and user applications. The OS manages resources such as memory,CPU,storage, and devices, ensuring efficient allocation and utilization. It also provides essential services like process management, file system management, and device management, enabling users to interact with the computer system effectively. Inaddition to the operating system, system software encompasses various utility programs and software libraries that assist in system management and maintenance. Utility programs perform tasks such as disk management, data backup, security scanning, and system diagnostics, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the computer system. Software libraries provide reusable code modules and functions that enable developers to build applications more efficiently by abstracting complex tasks and providing standardized interfaces.Overall, system software plays a foundational role in enabling the operation of computer systems, providing the necessary infrastructure and services for both users and application software to interact with hardware effectively. It forms an essential component of the computing ecosystem, facilitating the execution of tasks ranging from basic system operations to complex software applications.</p>
