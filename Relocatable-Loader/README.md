A relocatable loader is a type of software utility used in computing to load executable files into memory for execution. Unlike traditional loaders, which load programs into fixed memory locations, a relocatable loader has the capability to load programs into different memory locations each time they are executed. This flexibility allows the same executable file to be loaded and run in different memory spaces without modification.

The primary advantage of a relocatable loader is its ability to support programs that can be executed independently of their memory location. This is particularly useful in modern computing environments where memory allocation is dynamic and unpredictable. Relocatable loaders are commonly used in operating systems and development environments to facilitate the loading and execution of programs with varying memory requirements.

When a program is compiled, the compiler generates machine code instructions that are specific to the memory addresses where the program will be loaded. Relocatable loaders work by analyzing the compiled executable file and identifying memory references that need to be adjusted based on the actual memory location where the program will be loaded. These memory references are then modified to reflect the correct memory addresses before the program is executed.

In addition to loading executable files into memory, relocatable loaders may also perform other tasks such as resolving symbolic references, linking external libraries, and allocating resources required by the program. Overall, relocatable loaders play a crucial role in the execution of programs on modern computing systems by providing the flexibility and adaptability needed to support dynamic memory allocation and execution environments.
